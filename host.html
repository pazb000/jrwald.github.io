        <h1>Web Host Assingment</h1>'
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.godaddy.com"/a>Host 1 godaddy</h2>
        
        <p>I Choose godaddy because I was the most familar with them and wanted to learn more about the web provider. GoDaddy is one of the largest domain registrars globally, and they offer a wide range of domain registration services.</p>
             
         <h2><a href="https://www.bluehost.com"/a>Host 2 bluehost</h2>
        
        <p>I Choose blue host because it provides various add-ons and features, including email hosting, marketing services, and a variety of security options like SiteLock, CodeGuard, and SSL certificates.</p>
             
            <h2><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/"/a>Host 3 hostgator</h2>
        
        <p>I Choose hostgator because I had never heard of this web host prior to this assignment. </p>
